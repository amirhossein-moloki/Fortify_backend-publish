# Fortify: Messaging Platform with Django, REST API, and WebSocket

**Fortify** is a real-time messaging platform built using **Django**, leveraging **Django REST Framework (DRF)** for user management and **WebSocket** for real-time communication. It allows users to register, log in, and interact with messages instantly, making it an ideal solution for scalable messaging services with bidirectional communication.

---

## Features:
- **User Authentication**: Users can register, log in, and manage their profiles.
- **Real-Time Messaging**: Send and receive messages instantly using WebSocket.
- **Instant Updates**: Messages and notifications appear in real-time without page refresh.
- **REST API**: Exposes RESTful APIs for user management, message history, and more.
- **WebSocket Integration**: Real-time, bidirectional communication between users.

### Steps to Install and Set Up:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/username/fortify.git
   cd fortify
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment and activate it**:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate   # For Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install the required dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Set up environment variables**:
   Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add the following environment variables:
   ```ini

   DATABASE_URL=postgres://user:password@localhost:5432/dbname
   DEBUG=True
   DJANGO_SECRET_KEY=your-secret-key
   DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE=fortify.settings
   REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379/0
   PORT=8000  # Add this line for the port you're using with Gunicorn

   ```
   Replace each value with the correct settings for your environment. Be sure to configure the Redis and PostgreSQL servers before proceeding.

5. **Configure email settings**:
   In `settings.py`, make sure the email configuration is correctly set up:
   ```python
   # Email settings
   EMAIL_BACKEND = 'django.core.mail.backends.smtp.EmailBackend'
   EMAIL_HOST = config('EMAIL_HOST')
   EMAIL_PORT = config('EMAIL_PORT', cast=int)
   EMAIL_USE_SSL = config('EMAIL_USE_SSL', cast=bool)
   EMAIL_USE_TLS = config('EMAIL_USE_TLS', cast=bool)
   EMAIL_HOST_USER = config('EMAIL_HOST_USER')
   EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD = config('EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD')
   DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL = EMAIL_HOST_USER
   ```

   ```bash
   python manage.py makemigrations
   ```

7. **Run database migrations**:
   ```bash
   python manage.py migrate
   ```

8. **Start the Django development server**:
   ```bash
   gunicorn Fortify_back.asgi:application --workers 4 --worker-class uvicorn.workers.UvicornWorker --bind 0.0.0.0:$PORT
